ANALYZING QUERY 3.1 :

The query uses a subquery to transform the coordinates of restaurant points and administrative polygons to the same spatial reference system (3857), 
and then joins them using the ST_Contains function to count the number of restaurants within each administrative area. The GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses are 
used to aggregate the results and sort them by the restaurant count in descending order.

The EXPLAIN statement shows the execution plan of the query, which can be used to optimize it. The plan shows that the query uses nested loop joins 
and hash aggregates to compute the results. The plan also shows that there are two sequential scans of the planet_osm_point and planet_osm_polygon tables, 
which can be expensive if the tables are large.

To optimize the query, we can create indexes on the amenity column of the planet_osm_point table and the boundary and admin_level columns of the planet_osm_polygon table, 
which are used in the WHERE clauses of the subqueries. We can also create a spatial index on the way column of the planet_osm_polygon table to improve the performance of the 
ST_Contains function.

QUERY PLAN 3.1:

"Sort  (cost=618934.34..618934.35 rows=1 width=29)"
"  Sort Key: (count(*)) DESC"
"  ->  GroupAggregate  (cost=60002.93..618934.33 rows=1 width=29)"
"        Group Key: planet_osm_polygon.name"
"        ->  Nested Loop  (cost=60002.93..618934.29 rows=7 width=21)"
"              Join Filter: st_contains(st_transform(planet_osm_polygon.way, 3857), st_transform(planet_osm_point.way, 3857))"
"              ->  Gather Merge  (cost=59002.93..59003.05 rows=1 width=190)"
"                    Workers Planned: 2"

From the execution plan, we can see that the query uses nested loops for joining the restaurant points and administrative areas tables, 
which is not the most efficient way to perform this operation.The cost of the sorting operation is also high, which could be optimized. 
The query uses a GroupAggregate operator to group the results by area name and count the number of restaurants in each area.

To improve the performance of the query, we could consider using a spatial index on the way column of the planet_osm_point table and the planet_osm_polygon table. 
Additionally, we could consider using a different join method, such as a spatial join using the ST_Intersects or ST_Contains functions, which can be more efficient for spatial queries.
