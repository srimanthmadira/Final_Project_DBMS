ANALYZING QUERY 3.3:

The query is a join between the planet_osm_roads and planet_osm_polygon tables, with the condition that the road is a primary highway and the polygon is a park.

The join is performed using the ST_Intersects function, which checks whether the spatial objects of the two tables intersect with each other.

The query planner has chosen a nested loop join strategy, where it first scans the planet_osm_roads table using an index on the highway column, 
and then for each row it performs a bitmap heap scan on the planet_osm_polygon table using an index on the way column.

The Bitmap Heap Scan operation includes a filter on the leisure column, which checks if the polygon is a park. This filter is applied after the 
index scan on the way column, which could be inefficient if there are a lot of polygons that don't match the leisure = 'park' condition.


QUERY PLAN:

"Gather  (cost=1000.28..268194.15 rows=7676 width=38)"
"  Workers Planned: 2"
"  ->  Nested Loop  (cost=0.28..266426.55 rows=3198 width=38)"
"        ->  Parallel Seq Scan on planet_osm_polygon p  (cost=0.00..56285.91 rows=1374 width=190)"
"              Filter: (leisure = 'park'::text)"
"        ->  Index Scan using planet_osm_roads_way_idx on planet_osm_roads r  (cost=0.28..152.93 rows=1 width=165)"
"              Index Cond: (way && p.way)"
"              Filter: ((highway = 'primary'::text) AND st_intersects(way, p.way))".

The EXPLAIN output shows that the query uses a nested loop join between the planet_osm_roads and planet_osm_polygon tables. The planet_osm_polygon table is scanned 
using a parallel sequential scan and a filter is applied to select only those records where leisure = 'park'. The planet_osm_roads table is scanned using an index 
scan on the way column with the condition way && p.way and a filter is applied to select only those records where highway = 'primary' and way intersects p.way.

The cost of the query is estimated to be 1000.28 and the planner expects to use 2 workers to parallelize the operation. The estimated number of rows is 3198 and 
the estimated width of the result is 38.

Overall, the query seems to be optimized, as it utilizes an index scan to filter out unwanted rows and perform the intersection operation between the two tables. 
The parallel sequential scan on the planet_osm_polygon table could potentially benefit from indexing on the leisure column, but this would depend on the data 
distribution and cardinality of the column.
